# Stream Intermediate Steps

All runnables also have a method `streamLog()` which is used to stream (as they happen) all or part of the intermediate steps of your chain/sequence.

This is useful to show progress to the user, to use intermediate results, or to debug your chain.

You can stream all steps (default) or include/exclude steps by name, tags or metadata.

This method yields [JSONPatch](https://jsonpatch.com/) ops that when applied in the same order as received build up the RunState.
